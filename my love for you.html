     and it is very important to me because my partener is YOU!❤️ :D
    You might think this is quite funny and yea i agree i have no idea what im doing but im having fun with this :3
     ima try to make it the best i can and  hopefuly this isnt a fail lmao ❤️ 
    
    So the thing is i realy realy REAAALY wanna marry you my love . I see such a life with you and it looks amazing. 
    I am way happier than you think about this day because we get closer and closer to one year of being together and i only want that time to become more and i want to be able to see you easier while we get older together, and probably end up living with you the moment that it feels right.
